Decision Tree Implementation

This script is my own implementation of a Decision Tree. It's created to enhance my understanding of how Decision Trees work. 

Credit: 
    Inspired by "Normalized Nerd" for foundational understanding.
    This implementation is an acknowledgement of the insights gained from their material, aiming to apply and solidify my knowledge of Decision Trees in a practical manner.


Note: This is an educational implementation and may not reflect the performance optimizations of professional machine learning libraries.
